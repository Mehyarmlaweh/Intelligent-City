        As an expert architectural visualization system, generate a single detailed site plan image with a natural, hand-drawn quality. 

        Requirements from {self.collected_data}:
        1. Drawing Style:
        - Use organic, irregular paths for building footprints
        - Create natural curves for roads and paths
        - Add subtle shadows and depth
        - Include detailed landscape elements
        - Maintain architectural precision while avoiding rigid geometry

        2. Key Components:
        - Complex building shapes with angular geometries
        - Natural-looking tree placements along streets
        - Organic water features or green spaces
        - Detailed parking layouts
        - Pedestrian pathways
        - Site context and connections

        3. Technical Elements:
        - Scale: 1:1000
        - North arrow
        - Grid overlay (subtle, not dominant)
        - Clear legend
        - Building labels
        - Dimension lines where needed

        4. Color Palette:
        - Soft, architectural colors
        - Subtle shadows
        - Natural vegetation tones
        - Varied paving patterns
        - Water features in muted blues

    Create organic shapes using <path> elements with curved segments. Include shadow effects using subtle gradient fills. 

        Generate the image as a complete, professional architectural site plan that maintains the natural, 
        hand-drawn quality of traditional architectural drawings."""
