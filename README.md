# **Urban Bloom** - The Intelligent City Builder

<img src="./Assets/dalle1.png" width="49.7%"/> <img src="./Assets/dalle2.png" width="49.7%"/> 

Urban Bloom is a multi-agent system designed to generate eco-friendly city plans based on user input. The system uses specialized AI agents for business, infrastructure, energy, and vision planning, coordinated by a central agent. The user interacts with the system via a web interface built with Streamlit and FastAPI, deployed with Docker on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

The system processes user input,such as project details (population, surface area), and uses AI agents to generate a comprehensive city plan.

Agents:  
1. Principal Agent: Coordinates communication and handles user input.  
2.	Business Agent: Manages budget and financial details (via Claude Sonnet 3.5 on AWS Bedrock).  
3.	Infrastructure Agent: Plans building placement and neighborhood details (via Claude Sonnet 3.5).  
4.	Energy Agent: Recommends energy sources and sustainability practices (via Claude Sonnet 3.5).  
5.	Vision Agent: Generates 2D neighborhood visuals (via DALLÂ·E 3 on OpenAI API).  

Process Flow:  
1.	User Input: Upload a screenshot and provide project details.
2.	Agent Coordination: The Principal Agent sends input to specialized agents for processing.
3.	Final Report: A comprehensive report is generated, including budget, infrastructure, and energy details.
4.	2D Layout: If requested, the Vision Agent generates two 2D images of the neighborhood layout.
